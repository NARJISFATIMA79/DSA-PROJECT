## 📌 Development Log

### Day 1 – Project Setup
- Created the overall project structure  
- Added all required header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files  
- Defined classes and their responsibilities (initial skeleton, no logic)

> This phase focused on laying down the architecture before implementation.

### Day 2 – Initial Implementation
- Started writing code for selected modules  
- Implemented core methods and basic program flow  
- Focused on clarity and correct logic rather than optimization

> The system is now functional at a basic level and ready for further expansion.
